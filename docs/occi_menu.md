# OCCI Menu

This plugin adds a menu with a single item to the main FreeCAD menu bar called `Reset Repositories`. If you delete the default OCCI repository or have added repositories you do not want anymore, clicking this menu item will restore the repository listing to what it was the first time you launched the plugin. Use this with care as it will delete all other repository entries. Do not use it if there are entries you want to keep or do not want to re-enter.
